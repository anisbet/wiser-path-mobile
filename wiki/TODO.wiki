  # Fix POI so that it doesn't crash the app when it loads. DONE.
  # Authenticate user - tests show that you don't need a token from the form to authenticate but... DONE
  # Uploading a Geotagged Photo - these forms use a token and you must get it and return it with the post request. Also check out the API-key services for uploading images to Drupal. DONE
  # WiserPath tab should be able to search and display a route based on criteria like scenic or fastest.
  # Traces to include POIs if the trace is running and become part of the trace, not a standalone POI (also Incidents).
  # Finish UI refactoring and get Map working properly.
  # [LocalStorage Local Storage]

==Feature Request==
  # Give the Wiser Map a menu to select and control data from WP and/or WPM. *Done*

==Future Implementation==
  * The team leader would like to see the map pan as the user moves and the GPS updates. *Done but not tested*.
  * There should be a limit to the zoom level so that we can simplify data display.  *Done*. The problem is that as the we move across the map the desired POIs should be loaded as we move into a new reference frame (as defined by the bounding box of the tab screen boundaries), and the POIs that are no longer visible should be dumped from cache. *Needs implementing*.
